- 👋 Hi, I’m @malatjiportia
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics in the medical field...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data sscience, data analytics andHere are a few examples of projects you could include in your data analytics portfolio:

Sales Analysis Dashboard:
Create a dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to analyze sales data.
Include visualizations such as sales trends over time, regional sales performance, product profitability, and customer segmentation.
Customer Churn Prediction:
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn (customer attrition) for a telecom or subscription-based business.
Include data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and insights on factors influencing churn.
Market Basket Analysis:
Use association rule mining algorithms (e.g., Apriori) to analyze transaction data and identify frequent itemsets and association rules.
Create visualizations or a report showing popular product combinations and recommendations for cross-selling.
Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews:
Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Show sentiment distribution, key topics/themes in reviews, and sentiment trends over time to understand customer feedback.
Predictive Maintenance Model:
Build a predictive maintenance model using historical equipment sensor data to predict equipment failures or maintenance needs.
Include feature engineering, model selection (such as Random Forest or LSTM), performance metrics, and recommendations for proactive maintenance strategies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project:
Conduct a comprehensive EDA on a dataset of your choice (e.g., Kaggle datasets, open government data).
Showcase data cleaning techniques, feature engineering, correlation analysis, outlier detection, and visualizations to uncover insights.
Healthcare Analytics Project:
Analyze healthcare data (e.g., electronic health records, insurance claims) to identify trends, patient demographics, disease prevalence, or healthcare utilization patterns.
Highlight data privacy considerations and ethical practices in handling healthcare data.
Financial Fraud Detection:
Build a fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms (such as logistic regression or XGBoost) on a financial transaction dataset.
Showcase model performance, feature importance, and strategies for dealing with imbalanced data.
These examples cover a range of data analytics techniques and industries. Customize your portfolio projects based on your interests, expertise, and the type of roles you're targeting. Include detailed descriptions, code snippets, visualizations, and insights to make your portfolio impactful and informative.ro ...
